Title: The Rebirth of Star Wars

Goal: To document the journey that brought life back into the Star Wars franchise on a webpage(s).
 
Details: To gather the who, what, when, where, and why's in an organized timeline. 
  Ex) Who made what happen and when and for what movie.

Plan: Start with the process that brought everything together leading up to episode 7. Focus on the new trilogy(7, 8, 9) then will add in standalone movies (rogue one, han solo, obi-wan) later. Eventually will add information for the EU (comics, games, books, tv series).

Organization: [getting the franchise moving again > episode 7 > rogue one > episode 8 > han solo > episode 9]

Website Organization(pre planning): Maybe organize like a wiki page but thats uninteresting and boring, but more structured and organized. Another option could be to seperate main webpage into many many seperate webpages for each movie? 

Example of webpage navigation:
[movies] [comics] [games] [shows{animated}{live action}] [books]
Informations to include for:

[movies] > director, actors(casting if possible), locations, sets(pictures, behind the scenes), dates(pre-production, scripts, principle photography, pick-ups, reshoots, editing, trailers(marketing), release).

[comics] > going to have to ask Kyle about the process > writers, artists(illustrators), publishers(probably irrevelant).

[Games] > Publisher, developer(studio), dates(when project was picked up, alpha, beta, gold, release, patches(updates), dlc), content updates(patches, dlc), reception/reviews.

[shows{animated}] > studio, directors, voice actors, writer(s), animators (lead), sound, dates(seasons, trailers, release).
[shows{live-action}] > director, writer(s), locations, sets, ect similar categories to movies.

[books] > publishers, authors, dates(announcements, excerpts released, full release, audiobook [y/n]).
