<p>With the reboot of official canon material across all mediums there were new opportunities for new Star Wars games to tell new stories. The first being Star Wars Battlefront published by EA and developed by DICE. The game while scoring high marks for sound design and atmosphere was lacking in a lot of content players expected. Gamers wanted more content and even though the game was supported with several DLC expansions it never lived up to the expectations of fans.<br _><br _>

EA and DICE acknowledged that they heard all the major complaints and were working hard to rectify them with Star Wars Battlefront II. This time around Battlefront II would launch with a singleplayer campaign(book tie in and link to book page) and the multiplayer would cover all three eras of Star wars(Clone Wars, Original Trilogy, Sequel Trilogy).<br _><br _>

Other than the Battlefront series there are several other Star Wars titles currently under development by various developers.</p>
