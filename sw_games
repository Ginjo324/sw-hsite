<p>With the reboot of official canon material across all mediums there were now opportunities for new Star Wars games to tell new stories.<br _><br _>

<h2>Star Wars Battlefront</h2>

<p>publisher, developer, release date, dlc list and dates<br _><br _>

Star Wars Battlefront featured several different multiplayer game modes across a variety of maps along with several solo/coop missions that were basically horde/survival mode. The games sound, music, and environments feel like they are taken straight out of the movies. Though several dlc expansions were released post launch it didn't offer what people wanted. There was no single player campaign and the multiplayer lacked the depth people expected.<br _><br _></p>

<h2>Star Wars Battlefront 2</h2>

<p>publisher, developer, release date, dlc list and dates<br _><br _>

Star Wars Battlefront 2 has yet to release at the time of this writing. EA and DICE made it very clear that they heard the complaints from the first Battlefront and from what we've seen so far in preview and beta's that looks to be the case. We have a canonical single player story mode, and a completly reworked multiplayer mode that added a lot of depth.</p><br _><br _>

<h2>Various Unnamed Projects</h2>

<p>There are also several other Star Wars title being worked on by [insert developers and publishers]. We know next to nothing about them other than they are still currerently under development.</p>

Other than the Battlefront series there are several other Star Wars titles currently under development by various developers. Very little is know about these titles as all we really knoow for sure is the developers.</p>
